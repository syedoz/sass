# sass

A basic SASS templete to start working with.
It includes some basic plugins like.

Magnific Popup,
Custom styled checkbox,
Custom styles File Upload control,
Owl Carousel.

if you don't want to use any one of that just exclude it from imports in main.scss file.
It includes a doc.html file also showing which script and css you have to call to include that specific plugin with the markup example.

I am open to any suggestions or comments, Please help me make it better.
Thanks
